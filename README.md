# CCC Client Portal

## Overview
This repository contains a proof-of-concept client portal for the Calgary Counselling Centre (CCC). The portal allows clients to view information about their sessions and experiences at the Centre.

## Features
- **Client Information**: The portal provides clients with access to their session information and experiences at the Centre.
- **Agile Development**: This project was developed using Agile methodologies, including weekly sprint meetings, creation of diagrams, low/high fidelity prototypes, and interviews.
- **Technologies Used**: This portal was designed using HTML, JS, jQuery, CSS, and Bootstrap 5 libraries. The UX was adapted from the CCC brand book.
- **Testing**: Project was tested using white and black box tests carried out by myself, CCC staff, and external users.

## Challenges
The main challenges for this project were related to scope creep, JS synchronisation, UX/UI branding integration, work division, and report preparation and documentation.

## Results
Upon completion, the portal provided the CCC with insights into the changes they would need to make internally to realistically implement a client portal and gave them a point of reference for future development.

## Personal Development
This project emphasized the importance of concise project management and improved my ability to budget the time needed to develop software within a specific timeframe.
